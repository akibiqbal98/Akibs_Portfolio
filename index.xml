      <title>Reseacrh II: A GAN-based Federated Learning Architecture for Data Augmentation of Medical Images </title>

      <description>Workplan: The primary goal of this study is to improve data for medical images. Consequently, we must utilize GAN (Generative adversarial learning). GAN can be used to produce data, but it requires a substantial quantity of training data. The accessibility of training data is an obstacle for GAN because the sharing of medical data generates security concerns. Thus, we offer a novel decentralized strategy for producing more images for our GAN model.</description>

      <description>Datasets: One is RAVDESS Emotional speech audio that consists of 1440 files with randomized datas of speech collected from songs, audios and videos. Dataset CREMA-D focused more on accents and pronunciation by choosing actors of different ethnicity. Toronto emotional speech set (TESS) dataset has a collection of 2800 datas. Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (SAVEE) dataset was recorded from four native English male speakers. Data preprocessing: As we are working with four different datasets, so we will be creating a dataframe storing all emotions of the data in dataframe with their paths.</description>

      <description>This project is divided into 3 parts: Building a deep learning model to predict customer purchase completion Build a web app on Django to mount the prediction model. Deploy the Django project on heroky through github. The Deep Learning model: I have created a deep learning model or a sequential model with 3 hidden layers and train that model using the customer meta data - datapoints.
Dango Web App: This the is second part of the project where we build the web application usnig the framework Dango.</description>

      <description>WHY: Human society needs to increase food production by and estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an explected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion people. Currently, infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. The widespread distribution of smartphone among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020 offers the potential of tuening the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food.</description>

      <description>From a technical perspective, I do the following: Outline my analysis Load in and briefly explore the data Check for null values Organize the data so that it can be easily used to create charts Create some basic charts with plotly express and plotly go Organize the data so that it can be segmented by profession Build one “advanced visual” showing you the 4 iterations that it took me to get there Build a dropdown button for comparing between different datas for “Advance visual” Graphs and Plots Amount of Women by country Age by Position Link to Github Repository</description>
